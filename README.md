## Hello, my name is Jaqueline Souza Medeiros :space_invader:

I’m a 25 years old Statistician who graduated from the Federal University of Goiás in Brazil. Currently, I'm specializing in Data Science through Anhembi Morumbi University.

I tend to have an easier time learning while doing. So I'm writing a blog where I'll be documenting everything that I'm studying. My main interests are R, Python, NLP, ML, and Simulation.

You can find me at:
